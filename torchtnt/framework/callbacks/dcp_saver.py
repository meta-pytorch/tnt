class DistributedCheckpointSaver(BaseCheckpointer):
    """
    A callback which periodically saves the application state during training using `Distributed Checkpoint <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.checkpoint.html>`_.

    This callback supplements the application state provided by :class:`torchtnt.unit.AppStateMixin`
    with the progress, and active dataloaders (if applicable).

    The keys saved in a checkpoint will vary depending on the entrypoint used.
        - :func:`torchtnt.framework.train`: Save model weights along with other Statefuls, train_progress, and train_dataloader if saving within an epoch.
        - :func:`torchtnt.framework.fit`: Save model weights along with other Statefuls, train_progress, eval_progress. In this case both train_dataloader and eval_dataloader
            may be saved depending on the `evaluate_every_n_steps` configuration.
        - :func:`torchtnt.framework.evaluate`: Save only metrics and miscellaneous Statefuls, excluding model weights since they will not change. Save eval_progress and eval_dataloader.
        - :func:`torchtnt.framework.predict`: Save only metrics and miscellaneous Statefuls, excluding model weights since they will not change. Save predict_progress and predict_dataloader.

    When restoring from a checkpoint, the following is assumed:
        - If resuming from train or fit, the module parameters are restored, along with the progress and any other statefuls.
            The train_dataloader and evaluate_dataloader are restored if they are present in the checkpoint.
        - If resuming from evaluate or predict, the module parameters are not restored. Instead, it's expected that users will load them within their units.
            In this case only the progress, metrics, and dataloaders are loaded.

    Checkpoints will be saved under ``dirpath/epoch_{epoch}_<phase>_step_{step}`` where step is the *total* number of training steps completed across all epochs.

    Args:
        dirpath: Parent directory to save snapshots to.
        save_every_n_train_steps: Frequency of steps with which to save snapshots during the train epoch. If None, no intra-epoch snapshots are generated.
        save_every_n_epochs: Frequency of epochs with which to save checkpoints during training. If None, no end-of-epoch checkpoints are generated.
        save_every_n_eval_epochs: Frequency of evaluation epochs with which to save checkpoints during training. Use this if wanting to save checkpoints after every eval epoch during fit.
        save_every_n_eval_steps: Frequency of evaluation steps with which to save checkpoints during training. Use this if wanting to save checkpoints during evaluate.
        save_every_n_predict_steps: Frequency of prediction steps with which to save checkpoints during training. Use this if wanting to save checkpoints during using predict entrypoint.
        keep_last_n_checkpoints: Number of most recent checkpoints to keep. If None, all checkpoints are kept. If an excess of existing checkpoints are present, the oldest ones will be deleted to clean the difference. If best checkpoint config is enabled, this param will manage the top n checkpoints instead.
        best_checkpoint_config: Configuration for saving the best checkpoint based on a monitored metric. The metric is read off the attribute of the unit prior to checkpoint.
        process_group: The process group on which the ranks will communicate on. default: ``None`` (the entire world)
        async_checkpoint: Whether to perform asynchronous checkpointing. Default: ``True``.
        knob_options: Additional keyword options for StorageWriter. <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.checkpoint.html#torch.distributed.checkpoint.StorageWriter/>

    Note:
        If torch.distributed is available, there should be a process group is initialized. In this case DCP assumes the intention is to save/load checkpoints in distributed fashion.
        Additionally, a gloo process group must be initialized for async_checkpoint. For workloads that require nccl, the recommended initialization is 'cpu:gloo,cuda:nccl'

    Note:
        If checkpointing FSDP model, you can set state_dict type calling `set_state_dict_type <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html#torch.distributed.fsdp.FullyShardedDataParallel.set_state_dict_type>`_ prior to starting training.

    Note:
        If best_checkpoint_config is enabled, the attribute must be on the unit upon checkpoint time, and must be castable to "float". This value must be maintained by the unit, and updated
        appropriately. For example, if logging validation accuracy, the unit must be responsible for maintaining the value and resetting it when the epoch ends.
