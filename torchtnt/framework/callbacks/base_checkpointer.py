class BaseCheckpointer(Callback, metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    """
    Abstract base class for file-based state_dict checkpointing. This class can be used as the base of a checkpointing callback, and handles
    checkpointing frequency logic, checkpoint naming, checkpoint purging / upkeep, and process group synchronization. There are only two methods
    that need to be implemented by subclasses:

    1) ``_checkpoint_impl`` which implements the checkpoint saving logic, given the relevant checkpoint items and path.
    2) ``restore`` which implements restoring the checkpoint given the relevant checkpoint path.

    The subclass may override the ``metadata_fname`` attribute to specify the filename of the metadata file that will be written within the checkpoint directory.
    This will be used by this base class to ensure the integrity of the checkpoint. This is a list because some checkpointers may allow more than one valid
    ``metadata_fnames``, depending on storage or optimization configurations.

    If running in a distributed environment, the default process group should be initialized prior to instantiating this Callback. This is done automatically if
    using `AutoUnit`, which should be instantiated first.

    Args:
        dirpath: Parent directory to save checkpoints to.
        save_every_n_train_steps: Frequency of steps with which to save checkpoints during the train epoch. If None, no intra-epoch checkpoints are generated.
        save_every_n_epochs: Frequency of epochs with which to save checkpoints during training. If None, no end-of-epoch checkpoints are generated.
        save_every_n_eval_epochs: Frequency of evaluation epochs with which to save checkpoints during training. Use this if wanting to save checkpoints after every eval epoch during fit.
        save_every_n_eval_steps: Frequency of evaluation steps with which to save checkpoints during training. Use this if wanting to save checkpoints during evaluate.
        save_every_n_predict_steps: Frequency of prediction steps with which to save checkpoints during training. Use this if wanting to save checkpoints during using predict entrypoint.
        keep_last_n_checkpoints: Number of most recent checkpoints to keep. If None, all checkpoints are kept. If an excess of existing checkpoints are present, the oldest ones will be deleted
            to clean the difference. If best checkpoint config is enabled, this param will manage the top n checkpoints instead. Only supported for train or fit entrypoints.
        best_checkpoint_config: Configuration for saving the best checkpoint based on a monitored metric. The metric is read off the attribute of the unit prior to checkpoint. This param is ignored if not in train or fit entrypoints.
        process_group: The process group on which the ranks will communicate on. If the process group is not gloo-based, a new gloo-based process group will be created.

    Note:
        If torch.distributed is available and default process group is initialized, the constructor will call a collective operation for rank 0 to broadcast the dirpath to all other ranks

    Note:
        This class assumes checkpoint items are saved in the directory provided in ``_checkpoint_impl`` and will be in the form of ``<dirpath>/<epoch>-<step>/``. Checkpoint contents
        should be stored within this directory, as deleting and retrieving latest checkpoint relies on reading the <epoch>-<step> directory name within <dirpath>

    Note:
        If best_checkpoint_config is enabled, the attribute must be on the unit upon checkpoint time, and must be castable to "float". This value must be maintained by the unit, and updated
        appropriately. For example, if logging validation accuracy, the unit must be responsible for maintaining the value and resetting it when the epoch ends. If the metric value is None, the
        checkpoint will be saved, without the metric value in the checkpoint name
